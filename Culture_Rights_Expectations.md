# Culture, Rights and Expectations in the Coleman Research Group

_**Version 0.2:2021.07.16**_

Contributors: Joni Coleman

## Background

This document lays out the agreed rights and expectations of every member of the research group, with the aim of ensuring an inclusive, diverse, and collaborative environment in which members feel supported and enjoy their work. This is a living document, and is expected to alter over time as members contribute from their own experiences towards continually achieving that aim.

Version 0 of this document has been written by Joni alone. As such, it sets out aspirational goals for how the research group will run, but is not expected to be perfect. It is inherently limited by Joni's life experiences, and the privileges he benefits from within a society designed by and for people with similar identities to his own. With reference to the expectation of [**diversity**](Culture_Rights_Expectations.md#diversity) below, this document will not be considered complete (and so move onto version 1) until it has contributions from multiple members with more diverse viewpoints.

## Our Primary Research Aim

To improve the lives of people suffering from mental ill health by using results from statistical genomics to gain insights into the fundamental biology of mental illness.

Achieving this aim requires delivering the environment described in this document.

## Rights of members

### Inclusivity: 
Every member of this research group is a valued individual who has the right to choose to express their full identity while working in this group. This includes, but is not limited to, identities related to the following characteristics (or the absence thereof):

- Sex;
- Gender;
- Sexuality;
- Race and ethnicity\*;
- Class;
- Disability;
- Religion;
- All intersections of the above.

\* For an effective discussion of these terms in light of the statistical genetic research that is key to the group's research, see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10041.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10041.pdf).

### Work-life balance: 
Science is a competitive and challenging process, and over-working can severely damage wellbeing. Each member of the group has the right to manage their own work-life balance, and to work within their defined capacities. Note the expectations of **contractual work** and **wellbeing** below.

## Expectations on members

### Diversity: 
Effective science requires ideas to be considered from multiple perspectives, and as such demands diversity of thought and experience. There is an expectation on all members to actively seek out diverse opinions on the work of the group. In addition, recruitment into the group will be carried out in as fair and objective a manner as possible, and will actively encourage as diverse an applicant pool as possible.

### Respect for participants:
Much of the work done by the group will involve statistical analysis on data from large cohorts, often far abstracted from the real lives of the participants who contributed that data. It is imperative that all members recognize the immense contribution of research participants in providing such data, and their right to respect and privacy. All members will be expected to ensure that discussion of investigated traits is undertaken sensitively at all times in the group, and that participant privacy is appropriately prioritized during all work.

### Outreach and engagement:
The ultimate purpose of research within the group is to accrue knowledge in order to have a positive impact on the lives of people living with the conditions we study. One route by which we can achieve this impact is through appropriate outreach activities. We will seek out opportunities to discuss our research with people with lived experience, both as a mechanism of dissemination and as a mechanism to inform the direction and conduct of our current and future research direction.

### Honesty: 
Intellectual dishonesty is fraudulent and wastes vital time and resources. Researchers are human, and mistakes happen. All members of the group will be strongly supported in seeking to correct mistakes, and all mistakes (published or not) are expected to be corrected. If research is designed appropriately, null results are valuable and should be embraced.

### Wellbeing: 
The primary personal responsibility of members of the research group is to themselves and those they love. As such, members are expected to prioritize their own health and wellbeing, and to seek support if this comes into conflict with the expectation of **contractual work** as defined below.

### Contractual work:
Members of the research group enter into formal or informal contracts, typically with the university, that define their expected contribution to research in the course of their time with the group. Members are expected to fulfil the requirements of these contracts.

### Collaboration: 
The concept of the lone genius scientist is and always has been a myth, perpetuated by a failure to acknowledge the contributions of others. Developing as a scientist, and undertaking useful research, is reliant on enthusiastic collaboration. Members of the research group are expected to support each other in their research, and to work with others outside the group (including other researchers, but also other stakeholders in the research process) to further scientific progress. **Note that this is secondary to the right of work-life balance!**

### Openness: 
The majority of research data is supported through public funds – as such, it should not be considered the property of individual researchers. Similarly, guarding of research code serves to inhibit the progress of science, and to slow the impact of research in improving lives. As such, where it does not conflict with the expectation of **respect for participants** above, group members are expected to adopt open science practices. This includes pre-registration of analytical plans where feasible, open sharing of analytical code (and the collaborative use of version controlled coding systems such as GitHub), open dissemination of research data, and preprinting and open access publication of research outputs.

## Planned actions

Achieving the aims of this document require specific actions – some of these are detailed below with justifications

**Rename the group:** Although eponymous group names have some convenience, they imply that the group leader is the most important person in the group, which does not align with some of the principles described above. As such, the name "Coleman Research Group" is only intended to be temporary, and once the group is large enough a more appropriate name, based on our research aims, will be adopted.

**Convert archival project code to publicly-available code on a group GitHub.**

**Pursue and support research in multiple genetic ancestries:** Our field of human complex trait genetics is currently impaired by an over-representation of data drawn from individuals from European ancestries. Expanding the field to correct this over-representation, and particularly to expand research in individuals of African ancestry (whose genomes exhibit more complexity, and so can provide greater insight than genomes from other ancestries) is a key research priority for the field. Delivering this is complex – where possible, the research group will seek out opportunities to do effective work in data drawn from individuals from ancestries other than European. In many instances, the most effective research will be delivered as part of a wider program of investment into the scientific infrastructure with developing countries – an example of this is the H3 Africa project. The group will also look for opportunities to engage with and support these research projects.
